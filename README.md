## 🎨 About This Website

This isn't just a portfolio. It's a ✨ curated exhibit ✨ of my digital alter ego — where creativity meets clean code and personality shines brighter than a div's box-shadow.

### 🔍 What You'll Find:

- 👩‍💻 **Projects That Slap:** AI, design, web dev, chaos — I build it all.
- 🎯 **Skills On Fleek:** Frontend finesse, backend brawn, and ML magic.
- 🧠 **Blog Rants & Revelations:** Because sometimes Stack Overflow isn't enough.
- ☕ **About Me:** The story behind the pixels — sassy, driven, and slightly over-caffeinated.
